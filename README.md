# Contact VCF

Contact VCF is a simple and intuitive Android application that helps you manage your contacts from VCF files. It allows you to import your contacts, organize them into groups, and easily search and manage them.

**Please Note:** Currently, only VCF file import is working well. CSV import functionality will be improved in the future.
